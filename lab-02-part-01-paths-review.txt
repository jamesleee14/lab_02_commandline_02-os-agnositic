Feel free to use your workstation to test your answers to the questions that don't explicitly tell you to run a command)
==========
==========
1. Write the command that you would use to change to the root directory.
----------
$cd /


==========
2. Write the command that you would use to change to your home directory.
----------
$cd ~


==========
3. Write the command that you would use to change to your Desktop folder.
----------
$cd Desktop/


==========
4. What's the absolute path to your home directory?
----------
/c/Users/James


==========
5. What's the absolute path to your Desktop directory?
----------
/c/Users/James/Desktop


==========
6. What's the absolute path to your Desktop directory?
----------
/c/Users/James/Desktop


==========
7. If you're in your home directory, what's the relative path to your Desktop directory?
----------
$ cd Desktop

==========
8. If you're in your home directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called stuff without changing your directory?  Write your command below.
---------- 
I'm not too sure how to make one without changing my directory, but to do it with changing my directory, I would first go to my deskstop directory by doing $cd Desktop/ and then typing, $mkdir stuff. Then, I would do ls to check to see if a new directory called "stuff" is in my desktop directory.


==========
9. If you're in your root directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called more-stuff without changing your directory?  Write your command below.
----------
Like the question above, I'm not too sure how to do that. I would first just move to the directory by doing $cd Desktop/ and then doing $mkdir more-stuff.


==========
10. If you're in your Desktop directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called even-more-stuff?  Write your command below.
----------
I would do $mkdir even-more-stuff.


==========
11. If you're in your home directory, how would you change to the directory right above it using a relative path (it should bring you to /Users)?  Write your command below.
----------
I would do $cd ..


==========
12. If you're in your Desktop directory, how would you change to two directories right above it (again, this should be /Users) using a relative path?  Write your command below.
----------
I would do $cd../..


==========
13. What's the shortcut for changing to the directory that you were just previously in?  For example, if I were in /Volumes... and I changed to /Users/profesor/Desktop, what's a quick way of changing to /Volumes without writing something like cd /Volumes?
----------
I would press the UP arrow key and then press the ENTER key. I would also do UP and/or DOWN for when DOWN is necessary(if I go too far from the file I wanted) and then press ENTER key.


==========
14. How would you show all of the files (including hidden ones) with detailed (long) information that are on you're Desktop if you're in your home directory?  Write your command below.
----------
I would do $ls Desktop/ so that it can show the files in my desktop directory while I'm in my home directory. However, I am not sure if this showed my hidden files as well.

==========
Optional Challenge:

a. Create the following directory structure on...
b. A folder called my-stuff should be on your desktop.  There should be two additional directories within it: archived, current.
c. Determine the name of your computer.
d. Create another directory in my-stuff that's the same name as your computer.
e. Determine which folder in my-stuff was created most recently by using ls.  (there are some flags that help with this).
f. Remove that folder.
g. Show all of the commands that you used to complete the above exercise.  (for example, how did you determine which folder in my-stuff was the most recent?).  Use the command: history ... to help you remember what you did!  Paste the commands below.
