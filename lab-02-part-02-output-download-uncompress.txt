Lab - Output, Download and Uncompress
==========
Follow the instructions line-by-line.  

* Type in the commands as is, but ignore the beginning prompt.  
* Enter, tab, up and down are represented by <ENTER><TAB>,<UP> and <DOWN>.  
* "No output" or "nothing happens" are valid answers to any of the questions.
==========


==========
We're going to be echoing stuff to the console and cleaning it up.
==========
==========
1. Type:

$ echo hello

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
hello


==========
2. Type:

$ echo hello there

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
hello there


==========
3. Type:

$ echo good mornin'

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
It just gives > [BLANK]


==========
4. Uh-oh... we're stuck!

Type [CTRL + C] to get your prompt back.
----------
I did control C and it gave me this:
> ^C

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~
$

It wrote the command control C(^C) and it also gave me the prompt back to me.


==========
5. Say good mornin' again with quotes!

$ echo "good mornin'"

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
good mornin'


==========
6. There are some other symbols that have special meanings if you don't quote them.  For example, > brings up a different prompt.  Try *.

$ echo *

What happens?
----------
It gives out the list in the current directory. I am in the home directory so it printed out the list of my home directory but it did it weirdly. It printed it out by having a space apart from each other.

It's like a sentence but just writing words. 


==========
7. Ok... that's a lot of output.  How do we clean up our screen so that it's empty again?

Write the command that you used below:
----------
$clear or you can just exit visual studio code and run it up again.


==========
We're going to practice downloading files from a web site.  We'll use this practice to download more lab materials!
==========
==========
8. Now let's try downloading a file from a web site.  Type in the URL *exactly* as is: google.com.

$ curl google.com

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>


==========
9. And again.  This time, add www to the URL.

$ curl www.google.com

Copy and paste the output below, but not the whole thing!  Just copy up to the part that has the title tags (<title>......</title>).
----------
<!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="en"><head><meta content="Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for." name="description"><meta content="noodp" name="robots"><meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"><meta content="/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_128dp.png" itemprop="image"><title>Google</title>


==========
10. That's great, but what if I want to save the file?  What flag/option and option argument would I use to download the page to a file called google.html?  Run it to download the URL www.google.com.

Write the command you used below.  Also copy and paste the output below.
----------
You would do $curl google.html to download it and to download and save, you would do $curl -o filename.txt www.google.com

2 different files since that's what the question is asking for I think.


==========
11. Now let's download the lab file for this homework.  First, figure out what directory you're in.

Write the command you used to determine your directory.  Also, copy and paste the output below.
----------
I did $cd ~ and did pwd to check if I was in my home directory. 
/c/Users/James


==========
12. If you're not in your home directory, change to it (use the shortcut).

Write the command that you used to change to your home directory.  If you were already in your home directory, write the command that you *would* have used to change to it!
----------
$cd ~


==========
13. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Viera-MTEC1003-fall-2018/mtec1003-lab-02.zip

Download the file using curl... to a file called mtec1003-lab-02.zip using the commandline.  

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension! 

Use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to download the file below.  Additionally, write the output of the command below.
----------
$ curl -o filename.txt https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Viera-MTEC1003-fall-2018/mtec1003-lab-02.zip
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

100  920k  100  920k    0     0  5859k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 5902k


==========
14. We learned a command to uncompress a .zip file.  Use it to extract the files and folders from the file you just downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to uncompress the file.
----------
I think the command to do it would be $unzip filename since thats the file name I called it.

15. Change to the directory that was just created.  List the contents (of the directory that was extracted from the labs .zip file). 

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
I would do $cd mtec1003-lab-02/.

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~
$ cd mtec1003-lab-02/

We're going to mess around with archiving and compressing files.  We'll make a directory with a file in it... archive and compress it.... and uncompress it elsewhere.

16. Go back up to your home directory.  Create a directory called stuff.  List the contents of your home directory to prove that the directory was created.

==========
17. Change into the "stuff" directory that you just created.  Run the following command (we haven't learned this exact command yet, but we will in the next lab!) exactly as described below:

$ echo "hi" > hello.txt

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be stuff).  

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
hello.txt


==========
18. Go up one directory back into your home directory.  Run the following commands exactly to create a compressed archive of the stuff folder.

$ tar -cvf stuff.tar stuff

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be home).  

Copy and paste the output below.

21. Now compress it!  Type:

gzip stuff.tar

List your files again.... you should have a new file with a .gz extension.  Copy and paste the output of your this below.

22. Move stuff.tar.gz into the lab directory that we downloaded.  We didn't learn this command yet, so just type in exactly as is:

$ mv stuff.tar.gz mtec1003-lab-02 

MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE FILE THAT ENDS IN .gz!

Change your directory to mtec1002-lab-02.  

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (stuff.tar.gz should be there).
----------
books/  logs/  stuff.tar.gz  web/


==========
23. You should be in the lab directory.  Let's uncompress the file.

$ tar -xvf stuff.tar.gz

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (the folder, stuff, should be there).
----------
books/  logs/  stuff/  stuff.tar.gz  web/


==========
24. Go back to your home directory
[No output]
----------



==========
25. Download and uncompress this file using curl and tar -xvf in your home directory:

https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Viera-MTEC1003-fall-2018/secret.tar.gz

REMEMBER to use the -o flag and specifiy a filenmae that ends in .tar.gz

Write out the commands that you used to do this.
----------
$cd ~
$curl -o lab2 https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Viera-MTEC1003-fall-2018/secret.tar.gz
$mkdir stuff2
$tar -cvf stuff2.tar stuff2
$mv lab2 stuff2.tar
$gzip stuff2
$mv stuff2.tar.gz mtec1003-lab-02
$tar -xvf stuff2.tar.gz

I've done many attempts but I think this will be my last. This is what I got as a result. 

tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Skipping to next header
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors




==========
26. How many files were in the archive.  What were their names?  Write out your answers below.
----------
I don't know since the file won't uncompress.
